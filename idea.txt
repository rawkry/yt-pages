Here are some viral-worthy UI component ideas that perform well on short-form video platforms:
High-Engagement Components:

Glassmorphism cards with animated hover effects - the frosted glass look is very popular
Morphing buttons that transform into different shapes/colors on interaction
3D card flip animations revealing hidden content
Particle effect backgrounds that respond to mouse movement
Sliding drawer menus with smooth physics-based animations
Loading animations with creative visual metaphors (liquid fills, geometric transforms)
Toggle switches with satisfying micro-animations
Floating action buttons with ripple effects and icon morphing

Viral-Friendly Presentation Tips:

Start with a hook: "This CSS animation broke the internet" or "99% of developers don't know this trick"
Show the before/after transformation quickly (first 3 seconds)
Use trending music/sounds
Add captions explaining the "wow factor"
Include the final code snippet at the end
Make it easily copyable for viewers

Trending Aesthetics:

Dark mode with neon accents
Neumorphism (soft shadows, embossed look)
Cyberpunk/futuristic themes
Minimalist geometric designs
Retro/nostalgic interfaces

Platform-Specific Tips:

Keep it under 60 seconds
Portrait orientation works best
Bold, contrasting colors show up well on mobile
Include text overlays for context
